# Client-Data-Integration-for-Pre-Call-Optimization

One of the most impactful projects I worked on at Paychex was the Client Data Integration for Pre-Call Optimization. The challenge? Sales reps were spending too much time gathering client information from scattered sources before their calls, which affected their efficiency and the quality of client interactions.

To solve this, I developed a centralized solution that brought together data from multiple sources—Salesforce CRM, payroll, billing systems, and external platforms like LinkedIn and ZoomInfo—using SQL and ETL processes. This allowed us to create a single source of truth, giving sales reps instant access to real-time client insights.

Once the data was integrated, I designed customized Power BI dashboards and ad-hoc reports that visualized key metrics such as customer engagement, account health, and historical trends. With this solution, sales teams could quickly assess client needs and tailor their approach, leading to more meaningful and productive conversations.

The impact of this project was significant—it started with just 10 sales reps and scaled up to 180, reducing data retrieval time by 40% and greatly improving pre-call preparation. This transformation not only streamlined the sales process but also contributed to stronger client relationships and higher conversion rates.

This experience deepened my skills in data integration, visualization, and automation. More importantly, it reinforced my passion for using data-driven solutions to solve real-world business challenges.
